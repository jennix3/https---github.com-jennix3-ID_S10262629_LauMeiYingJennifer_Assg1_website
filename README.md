All About Taylor Swift

I decided to create a Taylor Swift website because I'm not just a fan of her music, but I'm also fascinated by her albums, tours, and everything that makes her concerts unforgettable. I made this website to easily showcase all her latest albums and when are her tours

Design Process
I made this website for Taylor Swift fans who like things simple and easy. You won't have to click around a lot - it's straightforward. I chose dark colors that remind you of a night sky, matching Taylor's latest album, "Midnight." The colors I used are deep blues, purples, and blacks to keep everything looking good together. There will be cool sections all about Taylor's latest album.

I decided to make the top navigation and bottom navigation this paper texture and beige colour to make it stand out more and give it a Taylor vibe

Features
In the navigation section, I have a drop down menu for "Tours". Not only that, in the tours page, I have a slideshow of taylor's youtube videos and a form for you to buy the tickets. In the footer I have also added Taylor's social media icons.

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
A working google map
